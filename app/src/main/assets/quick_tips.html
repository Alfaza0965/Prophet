<h1> Quick Tips </h1>
<div id="Purify_Water">
	<h3 > 1. Purify Water</h3>
		<p> You can purify water using any of the 3 methods listed: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> <h4> Boil</h4> </li>
				<p> Boiling is the simplest tactic among water purification methods to cleanse water that is unsafe because of micro-organism contamination such as viruses, parasites, or bacteria. The notion in this style of sanitation is that the micro-organism is eliminated by pushing the bacterium or virus past its heat range. One of the prevalent advantages here is that you are not adding any chemical to your water; however, boiling will not remove metals or harmful chemicals. So, be wary if the contaminants are metals, nitrates, pesticides, solvents and the like. </p>
			<li><h4>Solar Distillation<h4></li>
				<p>This is a practical manner of distilling water using the heat of the sun. Great for any water purifier camping situation, solar distillation can be done when a makeshift still can be constructed simply from readily available components to be a portable water purifier. It is then placed it over a small pit that is burrowed into the ground so that it can be used to make safe drinking water from unnatural water sources.  </p>
			<li> <h4> Filtration <h4></li>
				<p> When the water source is contaminated by wind-borne filth such as dry leaves, this type of filtration is best utilized. However, this method cannot be used when the raw water is highly turbid or muddy, since the sieve cannot filter fine suspended particles in raw water.</p>

<div id = "Starting_A_Fire">
	<h3>2. Starting A Fire</h3>
	<p> You can start a fire using the methods shown below: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><h4> Hand Drill </h4></li>
			<p> Using a hand drill is one of the simplest friction methods, but high speed can be difficult to maintain because only the hands are used to rotate the spindle. It works best in dry climates.

Step One Cut a V-shaped notch in the fireboard, then start a small depression adjacent to it with a rock or knife tip. Set a piece of bark underneath the notch to catch the ember.

Step Two Place the spindle, which should be 2 feet long, in the depression and, maintaining pressure, roll it between the palms of your hands, running them quickly down the spindle in a burst of speed. Repeat until the spindle tip glows red and an ember is formed.

Step Three Tap the fireboard to deposit the ember onto the bark, then transfer it to a tinder bundle and blow it to flame.</p>
		<li><h4>Fire Plough</h4></li>
			<p> This produces its own tinder by pushing out particles of wood ahead of the friction. Step One Cut a groove in the softwood fireboard, then plough or rub the tip of a slightly harder shaft up and down the groove. The friction will push out dusty particles of the fireboard, which will ignite as the temperature increases.</p>
		<li><h4> Using Magnifying Lens</h4></li>
			<p> Any sort of magnifying lens may be used to start a fire on a sunny day. This would include a regular magnifying lens, some sort of special magnifier , binoculars, glass bottle bottoms, eyeglasses (far-sighted prescriptions), and so on. A drop of water on the glass can intensify the sun light even further. You can even buy specialized "burning glasses", which are specially made for concentrating the sun's light for the purpose of starting fires. 

A pocket magnifier that is about one and a half inches in diameter, with the plastic case that swing away for use, is very handy. Any avid tracker/naturalist will usually want to carry one around anyway to examine minute plant details for identification, examine micro-details of tracks, start a fire, read fine print, or even hold it in front of your flashlight to disburse the beam in a wider area.

Simply hold the lens at such an angle as to focus the sun's light into as small an area as possible. Place some tinder under this spot and it will soon start to smoke and hopefully catch fire.</p>

<div id = "Building_A_Shelter">
	<h3>3. Building A Shelter</h3>
	<p> These are some methods for building a sufficent shelter: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><h4> Finding The Right Spot </h4></li>
			<p> Choosing the best place to build a survival shelter is important. It should be in the driest spot you can find. Nothing sucks out body heat faster than wetness. If it isn't too cold, build a shelter on high ground. Breezes will help keep the bugs away, and you'll be easier to see if a search party passes nearby. If a cold wind is blowing, choose a spot sheltered by trees. But don't build in the bottom of deep valleys or ravines where cold air settles at night.</p>
		<li><h4> The Caccoon Style Shelter</h4></li>
			<p>If it's almost dark and you can hurriedly collect dry debris (leaves, pine needles, bark) from the forest floor, make a pile two or three feet high and longer than you are tall. When you burrow into the pile, you are in a natural sleeping bag that protects against heat loss.</p>
		<li><h4> The Fallen Tree Style Shelter</h4></li>
			<p> The simplest shelter is a fallen tree that has enough room under it for you to crawl in. Lean branches against the windward side of the tree (so the wind is blowing into it and not against it) to make a wall. Make the wall thick enough to keep out wind. If you can build a fire on the open side of your shelter, the heat will help keep you warm.</p>
		<li><h4> The Lean To Style Shelter</h4></li>
			<p> If you find a fallen tree without enough room under it, or a rock or a small overhang, you can build a simple lean-to. Start by leaning fallen limbs against the object, such as the top edge of an overhang, to create a wall. Lean the limbs at an angle to help shield rain. Cover the leaning limbs with leaves, boughs, pine needles, bark or whatever the forest offers. When you have built a thick wall, you can crawl underneath into your shelter. Remember to make your shelter no bigger than you need to fit you and anybody else with you. The bigger the space, the harder it is to keep warm.

You can also build a lean-to by placing one end of a long stick across a low limb of a tree and propping up the other end of the stick with two more sticks. Tie the ends of the sticks together with your boot laces or belt. Lean more sticks against the horizontal stick. Then pile leaves and other forest debris against the leaning sticks until you have a wall. Once again, a fire on the open side of the lean-to will add much heat to your room.</p>
		<li><h4>The A-Frame Style Shelter</h4></li>
			<p>If you can't make a lean-to, you can make an A-frame shelter. You'll need two sticks four or five feet long and one stick 10 to 12 feet long. Prop the two shorter sticks up in the shape of the letter A. Prop the longer stick up at the top of the A. Tie the three sticks together where they meet. The three sticks will be in the shape of an A-frame tent with one end collapsed against the ground. Now prop up more sticks against the longer stick, and pile forest debris against the sticks until you have an insulated shelter open at the high end.</p>
		<li><h4>A Tarp Style Shelter</h4></li>
			<p>When you have a tarp, sheet of plastic or Space Blanket with you, and some rope or cord, tie a line between two trees. Tie it low to the ground with just enough room for you to lie beneath. Stretch the tarp over the line. Place large rocks or logs on the ends of the tarp to hold it in place with the edges close to the ground. If it's snowing, tie the line off higher on the trees. Steeper walls will shed snow better. Now you have an emergency tent.</p>
